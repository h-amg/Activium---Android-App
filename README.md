# [Activium](https://athletegrind.bubbleapps.io/) Android App
### **Sport activities management platform**
---

#### Find activities
Find sport activities like basketball games, football games and many more planned by other avid players nearby by simply browsing the map or using the search box.

#### Plan activities
Plan sport activities privately with your closed group and grab the activity link that directs anyone that uses it to your activity, where they can find all the details they need and RSVP "IN" if coming. Or make it public so anyone looking to join a game can find yours. Don't worry, you can always set a limit to the maximum number of players that can join your activity.

#### Organize competitions 
Organize sport competitions and league like a pro and let Activium do all the hard work for you, like registering participants, creating brackets, scheduling games, notifying participants about new updates and registering attendance. It's going to feel more like the NBA or FIFA than a competition organized by amateurs!
